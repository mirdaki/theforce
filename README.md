# The Force

> The Force is a gateway to abilities many believe are unnatural...

## Getting Started

Install Rust. We also provide a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container) if you would prefer to run it that way.

To run the examples:
```bash
cargo run examples/hello-there.force
```

To run with LLVM support (currently a WIP):
```bash
cargo run examples/hello-there.force --features llvm
```
